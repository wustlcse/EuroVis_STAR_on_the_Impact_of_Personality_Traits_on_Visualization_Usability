2019,No Sessions,Correlation Judgment and Visualization Features: A Comparative Study,"Recent visualization research efforts have incorporated experimental techniques and perceptual models from the vision science community. Perceptual laws such as Weber's law, for example, have been used to model the perception of correlation in scatterplots. While this thread of research has progressively refined the modeling of the perception of correlation in scatterplots, it remains unclear as t...","Fumeng Yang,Lane T. Harrison,Ronald A.

2019,No Sessions,Efficient and Anti-Aliased Trimming for Rendering Large NURBS Models,"In Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) are a common model representation for export, simulation and visualization. In this paper, we present a direct rendering method for trimmed NURBS models based on their parametric description. Our approach builds on a novel trimming method and a three-pass pipeline which both allow for a sub-pixel precise visualization. The rend...","Andre Schollmeyer,Bernd Froehlich,",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8314702/
2019,No Sessions,Smart Brushing for Parallel Coordinates,"The Parallel Coordinates plot is a popular tool for the visualization of high-dimensional data. One of the main challenges when using parallel coordinates is occlusion and overplotting resulting from large data sets. Brushing is a popular approach to address these challenges. Since its conception, limited improvements have been made to brushing both in the form of visual design and functional inte...","Richard C. Roberts,Robert S. Laramee,Gary A.

2019,No Sessions,Using Dashboard Networks to Visualize Multiple Patient Histories: A Design Study on Post-Operative Prostate Cancer,"In this design study, we present a visualization technique that segments patients' histories instead of treating them as raw event sequences, aggregates the segments using criteria such as the whole history or treatment combinations, and then visualizes the aggregated segments as static dashboards that are arranged in a dashboard network to show longitudinal changes. The static dashboards were dev...","Jürgen Bernard,David Sessler,Jörn Kohlhammer,Roy A. Ruddle,",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8283817/
2019,No Sessions,Deep-Learning-Assisted Volume Visualization,"Designing volume visualizations showing various structures of interest is critical to the exploratory analysis of volumetric data. The last few years have witnessed dramatic advances in the use of convolutional neural networks for identification of objects in large image collections. Whereas such machine learning methods have shown superior performance in a number of applications, their direct use...","Hsueh-Chien Cheng,Antonio Cardone,Somay Jain,Eric Krokos,Kedar Narayan,Sriram Subramaniam,Amitabh Varshney,",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8265023/
2019,No Sessions,Efficient Local Statistical Analysis via Point-Wise Histograms in Tetrahedral Meshes and Curvilinear Grids,"Local histograms (i.e., point-wise histograms computed from local regions of mesh vertices) have been used in many data analysis and visualization applications. Previous methods for computing local histograms mainly work for regular or rectilinear grids only. In this paper, we develop theory and novel algorithms for computing local histograms in tetrahedral meshes and curvilinear grids. Our algori...","Bo Zhou,Yi-Jen Chiang,Cong Wang,",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8267140/
2019,No Sessions,Exploration Strategies for Discovery of Interactivity in Visualizations,"We investigate how people discover the functionality of an interactive visualization that was designed for the general public. While interactive visualizations are increasingly available for public use, we still know little about how the general public discovers what they can do with these visualizations and what interactions are available. Developing a better understanding of this discovery proce...","Tanja Blascheck,Lindsay MacDonald Vermeulen,Jo Vermeulen,Charles Perin,Wesley Willett,Thomas Ertl,Sheelagh Carpendale,",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8281629/
2019,No Sessions,Tensor Decompositions for Integral Histogram Compression and Look-Up,"Histograms are a fundamental tool for multidimensional data analysis and processing, and many applications in graphics and visualization rely on computing histograms over large regions of interest (ROI). Integral histograms (IH) greatly accelerate the calculation in the case of rectangular regions, but come at a large extra storage cost. Based on the tensor train decomposition model, we propose a ...","Rafael Ballester-Ripoll,Renato Pajarola,",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8281540/

A typical approach to explore such data utilizes interactive visualizations with multiple coordinated views. Each view displays the aggregated measures along one or two dimensions.

Many studies have demonstrated that visualization techniques for multi-dimensional data are beneficial to understand fuzzy clusters. However, no empirical evidence exists on the effectiven...","Ying Zhao,Feng Luo,Minghui Chen,Yingchao Wang,Jiazhi Xia,Fangfang Zhou,Yunhai Wang,Yi Chen,Wei Chen,",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440829/
