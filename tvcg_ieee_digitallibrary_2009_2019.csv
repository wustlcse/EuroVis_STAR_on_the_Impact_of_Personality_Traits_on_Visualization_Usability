2019,No Sessions,Compressing Color Data for Voxelized Surface Geometry,"We explore the problem of decoupling color information from geometry in large scenes of voxelized surfaces and of compressing the array of colors without introducing disturbing artifacts. In this extension of our I3D paper with the same title [1] , we first present a novel method for connecting each node in a sparse voxel DAG to its corresponding colors in a separate 1D array of colors, with very ...","Dan Dolonius,Erik Sintorn,Viktor Kämpe,Ulf Assarsson,",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8013133/
2019,No Sessions,Feature-Based Volumetric Terrain Generation and Decoration,"Two-dimensional height fields are the most common data structure used for storing and rendering of terrain in offline rendering and especially real-time computer graphics. By its very nature, a height field cannot store terrain structures with multiple vertical layers such as overhanging cliffs, caves, or arches. This restriction does not apply to volumetric data structures. However, the workflow ...","Michael Becher,Michael Krone,Guido Reina,Thomas Ertl,",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8066313/
2019,No Sessions,Real-Time Cloth Rendering with Fiber-Level Detail,"Modeling cloth with fiber-level geometry can produce highly realistic details. However, rendering fiber-level cloth models not only has a high memory cost but it also has a high computation cost even for offline rendering applications. In this paper we present a real-time fiber-level cloth rendering method for current GPUs. Our method procedurally generates fiber-level geometric details on-the-fly...","Kui Wu,Cem Yuksel,",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7993021/
2019,No Sessions,Improved Alpha Testing Using Hashed Sampling,"We further describe and analyze the idea of hashed alpha testing from Wyman and McGuire [1] , which builds on stochastic alpha testing and simplifies stochastic transparency. Typically, alpha testing provides a simple mechanism to mask out complex silhouettes using simple proxy geometry with applied alpha textures. While widely used, alpha testing has a long-standing problem: geometry can disappea...","Chris Wyman,Morgan McGuire,",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8010336/
2019,No Sessions,A Coloring Algorithm for Disambiguating Graph and Map Drawings,"Drawings of non-planar graphs always result in edge crossings. When there are many edges crossing at small angles, it is often difficult to follow these edges, because of the multiple visual paths resulted from the crossings that slow down eye movements. In this paper we propose an algorithm that disambiguates the edges with automatic selection of distinctive colors. Our proposed algorithm compute...","Yifan Hu,Lei Shi,Qingsong Liu,",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8269823/
2019,No Sessions,A Psychophysical Evaluation of Texture Compression Masking Effects,"Lossy texture compression is increasingly used to reduce GPU memory and bandwidth consumption. However, as raised by recent studies, evaluating the quality of compressed textures is a difficult problem. Indeed using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) on texture images, like done in most applications, may not be a correct way to proceed. In particular, there is evidence that masking effects apply wh...","Guillaume Lavoué,Michael Langer,Adrien Peytavie,Pierre Poulin,",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8292880/
2019,No Sessions,Animation Plans for Before-and-After Satellite Images,"Before-and-after image pairs show how entities in a given region have evolved over a specific period of time. Satellite images are a major source of such data, that capture how natural phenomena or human activity impact a geographical area. These images are used both for data analysis and to illustrate the resulting findings to diverse audiences. The simple techniques used to display them, includi...","María-Jesús Lobo,Caroline Appert,Emmanuel Pietriga,",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8267097/
2019,No Sessions,ColorMapND: A Data-Driven Approach and Tool for Mapping Multivariate Data to Color,"A wide variety of color schemes have been devised for mapping scalar data to color. We address the challenge of color-mapping multivariate data. While a number of methods can map low-dimensional data to color, for example, using bilinear or barycentric interpolation for two or three variables, these methods do not scale to higher data dimensions. Likewise, schemes that take a more artistic approac...","Shenghui Cheng,Wei Xu,Klaus Mueller,",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8302605/
2019,No Sessions,Deep-Learning-Assisted Volume Visualization,"Designing volume visualizations showing various structures of interest is critical to the exploratory analysis of volumetric data.

Whereas such machine learning methods have shown superior performance in a number of applications, their direct use...","Hsueh-Chien Cheng,Antonio Cardone,Somay Jain,Eric Krokos,Kedar Narayan,Sriram Subramaniam,Amitabh Varshney,",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8265023/
2019,No Sessions,Efficient Local Statistical Analysis via Point-Wise Histograms in Tetrahedral Meshes and Curvilinear Grids,"Local histograms (i.e., point-wise histograms computed from local regions of mesh vertices) have been used in many data analysis and visualization applications. Previous methods for computing local histograms mainly work for regular or rectilinear grids only. In this paper, we develop theory and novel algorithms for computing local histograms in tetrahedral meshes and curvilinear grids. Our algori...","Bo Zhou,Yi-Jen Chiang,Cong Wang,",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8267140/
2019,No Sessions,Exploration Strategies for Discovery of Interactivity in Visualizations,"We investigate how people discover the functionality of an interactive visualization that was designed for the general public. While interactive visualizations are increasingly available for public use, we still know little about how the general public discovers what they can do with these visualizations and what interactions are available. Developing a better understanding of this discovery proce...","Tanja Blascheck,Lindsay MacDonald Vermeulen,Jo Vermeulen,Charles Perin,Wesley Willett,Thomas Ertl,Sheelagh Carpendale,",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8281629/

Unlike the technique of van Wijk and Nuij, the animations produced by our technique are smooth at the endpoints and when interrupted by a change of target. To analyze the results of our technique, we introduce world/screen diagrams, a novel technique for visualizing ...","Andrew McCaleb Reach,Chris North,",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8276573/
2019,No Sessions,Tensor Decompositions for Integral Histogram Compression and Look-Up,"Histograms are a fundamental tool for multidimensional data analysis and processing, and many applications in graphics and visualization rely on computing histograms over large regions of interest (ROI). Integral histograms (IH) greatly accelerate the calculation in the case of rectangular regions, but come at a large extra storage cost. Based on the tensor train decomposition model, we propose a ...","Rafael Ballester-Ripoll,Renato Pajarola,",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8281540/

A typical approach to explore such data utilizes interactive visualizations with multiple coordinated views. Each view displays the aggregated measures along one or two dimensions. By brushing on the views, analysts c...","Dongyu Liu,Panpan Xu,Liu Ren,",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440840/
2019,No Sessions,Evaluating Multi-Dimensional Visualizations for Understanding Fuzzy Clusters,"Fuzzy clustering assigns a probability of membership for a datum to a cluster, which veritably reflects real-world clustering scenarios but significantly increases the complexity of understanding fuzzy clusters. Many studies have demonstrated that visualization techniques for multi-dimensional data are beneficial to understand fuzzy clusters. However, no empirical evidence exists on the effectiven...","Ying Zhao,Feng Luo,Minghui Chen,Yingchao Wang,Jiazhi Xia,Fangfang Zhou,Yunhai Wang,Yi Chen,Wei Chen,",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440829/

Some VEs have been purposely developed for visualization applications, while many visualization applications are exemplary showcases in general-purpose VEs. Because of the development and operation costs of VEs, the majority of visualization applications in practice have yet ...","Min Chen,Kelly Gaither,Nigel W.
